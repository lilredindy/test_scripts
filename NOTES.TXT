what is it LIKE to be a bat (for a bat or a human)?  letter i read, that discusses what it is like to be a bat...
the writer may be requiring that a bat has consciousness?
a question that enters my head is do bats think?  if mental processes are prereqs for consciousness then my guess is they are not conscious, however,
if consciousness only requires some vague definition of awareness then perhaps they are conscious. for example, a giraffe knows (non mental process) there is tree with leafy greens for him to eat. or an elephant becomes highly aware of it's situation because there is a lion nearby (awareness via instincts not awareness thru mental processes)

my definition of consciousness is a simply a higher state of awareness if there is such a thing.
this begs the question, what does higher level awareness really require?  assuming only humans are capable, maybe a sense of otherness?  :(

what is experience? isn't it after the fact?
does experience require consciousness?
if experience requires higher level mental activity (think, understand, etc) then i would claim then most animals may not have experiences.
however, if experience only requires awareness, then it maybe possible for non-human animals to undergo experience.  
it seems more reasonable to me that I understand that I have experiences rather than actually having experiences.  have u ever been experienced (past tense)? if you are constantly obsessed with having experiences, you may ask yourself, 'how do i know i am having an experience?' this may lead oneself to do all sorts of things to help remember one's experiencing capacity....taking photos, talking about what one is doing while doing it, etc.  

can a plant have experience?  it has no brain at all. there is no awareness of it's living and dying.  perhaps we are saying that most animals are like plants, they have no awareness of their lives. 
do plants and tree experience pain? probably not, but we can assume that animals surely do.

-The biblical concept of righteousness was rooted in the covenant-making God who had ordered creation for communal well-being, ("OR the covenant making man who has ordered God for communal well-being") 
and the righteous were those who invested in the community, the wicked in sin. satan raises the question of whether there is such a thing as disinterested righteousness: if God rewards righteousness with prosperity, will men not act righteously from selfish motives? He asks God to test this by removing the prosperity of Job, the most righteous of all God's servants.[34]

And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity?
Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. 9:22 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.

As one of the great Zen masters, Dzogchen, said, you do not create karma by committing suicide. You create karma from the way you commit suicide. We know that all reactions, all karma, all momentum, whatever you want to call it, comes from the intention behind the act.

"In Vincent's reality, images also had to have significance.  Any image that did not reach beyond its immediate subject in search of a deep meaning, a broader relevance, he dismissed as mere "impression" an ephemeral artifact, like a sketch, useful in his continuing quest for something more "noble and serious"  To achieve significance, an image had to strip away the specifics and concentrate on what makes us sit up and think.  an image that rises above nature, is the highest thing in art.

van gogh is a hyper-aesthetic...who perceives with abnormal, perhaps even painful, intensities, invisible to healthy eyes and removed from banal paths, his is a brain at its boiling point, irresitibly pouring down its lava into all ravines of art, a terrible and demented genius, often sublime, sometimes grotesque, always at brink of the pathological
only a few were chosen by nature, not affect, by instinct, not intellect. only the few, the geniuses, the criminals, the madmen--the savages among us--could see past the banal surface of bourgeois complacency  to the universal mad and blinding coruscaiton of things
the necessary advent of a man, a messiah, a sower of truth, who would regenerate the decrepitude of our art and perhaps of your imbecile and industrialist society

"artists die like women die, like women who have loved much and been hurt by life"
"my aim in life is to make pictures and drawings as many and as well as i can, then, at the end of my life, i hope to pass away looking back with love and tender regret thinking oh, the pictures i might have made

"i feel more and more that we not judge of God from this world. it's just a study that didnt come off.  what can u do with a study that has gone wrong?  if u r fond of the artist, u do not find much to criticize you hold your tongue. but u have the right to ask for something better.  we should have to see other works by the same hand though, this world was evidently slapped together in a hurry on one of his bad days, when the artist didnt know what he was doing or didnt have his wits about him.  all the same, the this good old god took a terrible lot of trouble over this world study of his
i am inclined to think that the legend is right, but then the study is ruined in so many ways. it is only a master who can make such a blunder and perhaps that is the best consolation we can have out of it, since in that case we have a right to hope that we'll see the same creative hand get even with itself. and this life of ours, so much criticized, and for good and even exalted reasons, we must not take it for anything but what it is, and go on hoping that in some other life we'll see something better than this.

the establishment of social, religious, and political institutions was an important part of the pioneering process. The settlers on the northern plains were homesteading families, not wandering adventurers like trappers and herders.  The farmers depended upon their ability to transform their environment.  The vastness of the prairie was  threatening and disorienting to them, and as soon as they arrived, the settlers began staking physical and psychological claims in the dangerous open space that surrounded them, and initiating the slow process of transformation: nature into society.  The indigenous population was composed of Winnebago Indians, whose attitude toward the land was communal and spiritual.  Threatened by this "irrational"  approach, the settlers congratulated themselves on its banishment.  They established a rational, objective system: the plains were surveyed into neat, geometrical parcels, and each parcel had a particular and individual owner
