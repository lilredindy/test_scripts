REVISED 12.12.17

question 2 update:
I have refactored the code a bit to use page object design pattern...
still more refactoring is possible but would need to evaluate

compile and run:
javac *.java
java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore CrowdTwistTests



question 1.

Normally in my experience the test cases are based upon the acceptance criteria for the component or feature in development.
These test cases are more developed around heuristical principles

question2.

installation requirements: jdk, junit, chrome 63, chromedriver 2.33, selenium 2.45, 
compile and execute from CLI:
javac CrowdTwist.java
java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore CrowdTwist

I have only tested script with Chrome 63 and ChromeDriver 2.33 on os x
I have not used page-object design pattern, refactor l8r 
testcases for both registration and checkout in single test-class
only handful of testcases automated
under better circumstances use a DB cleanup script

question3.
next step is to convert into living document,aka HTML format, and increase visibility via intranet
